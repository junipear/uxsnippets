#accordian.html is designed to be a month's worth of deals for a site. You use a rectangular image, and do them for all the products, then load them into the images folder. This one is done on magento, but it would be easy to do on any other CMS or coded into an html or php doc. 
#filterable-list.html is designed to filter data from li. This one is pure vanilla.
